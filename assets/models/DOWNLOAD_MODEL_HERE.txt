IMPORTANT: TensorFlow Lite Model Required
==========================================

This application requires a TensorFlow Lite model for NSFW content detection.

To make the app fully functional:

1. Download an NSFW detection model:
   - Recommended: https://github.com/GantMan/nsfw_model/releases
   - Look for: nsfw_mobilenet_v2_224_1.tflite

2. Rename the model file to: nsfw_model.tflite

3. Place it in this directory: assets/models/nsfw_model.tflite

4. Rebuild the app: flutter build apk --release

Note: Due to ethical considerations, we cannot include a pre-trained
NSFW detection model in the repository. You must obtain and add your own model.

The app will work without the model, but the NSFW detection feature will not
function until a valid TensorFlow Lite model is added.
